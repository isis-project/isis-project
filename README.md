## Isis Browser

Open webOS uses a version of QtWebKit to render web pages and applications. Code-named, "Isis-Project", it uses a client-server model that separates the rendering process from the user interface. This architectural approach delivers smooth scrolling and a responsive user experience. The Isis Browser uses the highly portable QT framework with the goal of delivering a cross-platform browser in the future.
